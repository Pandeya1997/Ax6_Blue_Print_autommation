  1.   The main focus in Procedural Programming is on how to do the task, meaning, on the structure or procedure of the program.
  2.   The Procedural Programming follows a Top-Down approach.

 1.    The main focus in Object Oriented Programming is on data security. Hence, it only permits objects to access the class entities.
 2.    The Object Oriented Programming follows a Bottom-Up approach.
 3.    Hiding data is possible with Object Oriented Programming due to the abstraction. Thus, it is more secure than the Procedural Programming.
